# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

To install the package, run `npm install package-name`.

````javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}



(Note: Remove the extra indentation from the triple backticks in your actual Markdown file; it's used here to escape the code block within another code block.)

### No Language Specific

If you don't want to specify the programming language or if the code doesn't belong to a specific programming language, just use the triple backticks without adding a language name.

```markdown
````
